	  <p>Use deep breathing to de-stress: The more you relax the more your heartrate will by in sync with your breathing. 
	  We've made a biofeedback app which turns your heartrate into a seaside animation. The heartbeat (ECG) is measured with the <a href="https://Attys www.attys.tech">Attys</a>.

	  <p>Attys-HRV helps you to de-stress. Here is why: your heart beats a bit faster when you are breathing in and a bit slower when you are breathing out. The more relaxed you are the more your heart-rate changes during breathing. However, this also works the other way around: you can use deep breathing to de-stress which in turn will change your heart-rate according to your breathing.
We have made a biofeedback app which turns your heartrate change into a seaside animation where the waves change according to your heartrate.
This app uses the Attys (www.attys.tech) to transmit your heartbeat (ECG) to the Oculus. Just connect the positive electrode to the left ankle (or hip), the negative one to the right shoulder and the ground electrode to the left shoulder.

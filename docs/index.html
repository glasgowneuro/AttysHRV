	  <p>Use deep breathing to de-stress: The more you relax the more your heartrate will by in sync with your breathing. 
	  We've made a biofeedback app for the Oculus Quest 2 which turns your heartrate into a seaside animation.
    The heartbeat (ECG) is measured with the <a href="https://www.attys.tech">Attys</a>.

      <p>Your heart beats a bit faster when you are breathing in and a bit slower when you are breathing out. 
      The more relaxed you are the more your heart-rate changes during breathing. 
      However, this also works the other way around: you can use deep breathing to de-stress which in 
      turn will change your heart-rate according to your breathing.</p>

    <h4>How to use</h4>

    <p>
      You need an:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.oculus.com">Oculus Quest 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://Attys www.attys.tech">Attys</a></li>
      </ol>
      The <a href="">Attys</a> transmits your heartbeat (ECG) to the Oculus Quest 2.
    </p>

    <p>Put the Attys in your pocket and connect its positive electrode to your left ankle (or hip), the negative one to the right shoulder 
    and the ground electrode to the left shoulder. Make sure the Attys is paired with the Oculus Quest 2.</p>

    <p>Start AttysHRV.</p>

    <p>Breath deeply and watch the waves.</p>
